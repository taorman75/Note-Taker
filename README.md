## Description

This application is designed for the user to be able to write, recall, and delete notes, using a simple interface powered by Express.

## Usage

This app requires installation of express for node.js, as well as uuid v1 (https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuidv1).

When the app opens, the index page displays as below. The user will click "Get Started" to open the notes workspace.

To begin, the user will either create a note in the workspace (adding title and text) or open a note from the left panel of the page. Clicking on the pencil in the upper right hand corner will automatically clear the main workspace for a new note.
